The Curse of Dimensionality

The Curse of Dimensionality is a term used in to describe the problems 
that arise when data is in high-dimensional spaces (i.e., has many features or variables).

🧍‍♂️ You lost your wallet...

Case 1: On a straight road (1D)

You just walk forward or backward.

👉 Easy to search.

✅ Case 2: On a square ground (2D)

Now you have to walk left-right AND forward-backward.

👉 Takes more time.

⚠️ Case 3: In a 5-floor college building (3D or more)

Now you must search every floor, every room, and every direction.

👉 Much harder and slower.

That’s the curse of dimensionality – things get harder when we have too many features (columns) in our data.

🧠 In Machine Learning:

When your data has too many columns/features:

Data gets very spread out – like one person in a huge city.

Algorithms get confused – they can’t easily find patterns.

Model may overfit – it learns the noise, not the real pattern.


🛠️ What Can We Do?

Remove useless features (Feature Selection)

Shrink the data to fewer useful features (Dimensionality Reduction like PCA)
