Advantages of SimpleImputer
Easy to Use

Very simple and straightforward API in scikit-learn.

Handles Missing Data Quickly

Efficient for small to medium datasets with missing values.

Flexible Strategies

Supports multiple imputation strategies: mean, median, most_frequent, and constant.

Integrates with Pipelines

Works seamlessly with Pipeline in scikit-learn, helping in automating ML workflows.

Prevents Model Errors

Many ML models (e.g., linear regression, decision trees) cannot handle NaN. SimpleImputer ensures compatibility.

❌ Disadvantages of SimpleImputer
Loss of Data Variance

Imputing with mean or median reduces data variability, which can lead to less accurate models.

Ignores Feature Relationships

Doesn't consider relationships between features. For example, it imputes values without using context from other columns.

Not Suitable for Complex Patterns

Cannot capture patterns in missing data. Better techniques like KNNImputer or IterativeImputer might work better for complex datasets.

Bias in Statistics

Imputation with fixed values (like mean) can bias statistical analysis, especially when missing data is not random.

Only Works Column-wise

Each column is treated independently, which may not be ideal for time-series or grouped data.

✅ Use SimpleImputer When:
You need a quick fix for missing values.

You are working with clean, tabular data where missingness is small and random.

❌ Avoid It When:
You are dealing with non-random missingness.

Your model requires more accurate imputation or uses correlations between features.
