What is MICE?

Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations

Instead of guessing randomly or using average values, it looks at other data to predict what the missing value could be.

How MICE Works:
 
Initialize missing values (e.g., with mean/mode).

Pick one column with missing values.

Treat it as a regression problem, and use the other columns to predict the missing values.

Update that column with predicted values.

Repeat the process for each column with missing data.

Perform multiple rounds (iterations) to stabilize imputations.

# MICE imputer

imputer = IterativeImputer()


Pros

Better than simple imputation methods.

Maintains statistical relationships between variables.

Useful for complex datasets.

Cons

Computationally expensive.

Not ideal for very large datasets or time-sensitive tasks.

May introduce bias if not used properly.
