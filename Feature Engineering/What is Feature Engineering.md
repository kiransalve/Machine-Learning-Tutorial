Feature engineering is the process of creating or modifying input data (features) to help a machine learning model learn better and make more accurate predictions.

Simple Example:

If you have a date column, you can create new features like day, month, or weekday — this helps the model understand patterns better.

Why it’s important:
Good features = Better model performance
Poor features = Poor results, even with advanced algorithms



1. Feature Transformation :

Missing Values Imputation :

Our data has missing value or empty Null values
ML algorithm do not accept the data with missing value
so we have to fill it or remove it
If values are less then we can remove it 
But large values are empty then we have to fill it


Handling Categorical Features
We convert categorical data into numerical

Outlier Detection
Outlier detection means finding data points that are very different from the rest — values that are too high or too low compared to others.

Why Detect Outliers?
They can skew averages or results.
They might show errors in data (like a typo ₹999999 instead of ₹999).
Or they might reveal something important — like fraud or unusual behavior.


Feature Scaling :
Feature scaling means adjusting the values of your data so that all features are on a similar scale (range).
This helps machine learning models learn better and faster, especially models that rely on distance or gradient-based optimization.

Why is Feature Scaling Important?
Some algorithms are sensitive to the scale of features.
If one column has values from 0–1000 and another from 0–1, the model might give more importance to the bigger numbers — even if they aren’t more important.

| Needs Scaling         | Doesn’t Need Scaling |
| --------------------- | -------------------- |
| ✅ KNN                 | ❌ Decision Trees     |
| ✅ SVM                 | ❌ Random Forest      |
| ✅ Logistic Regression | ❌ XGBoost            |
| ✅ Neural Networks     | ❌ Naive Bayes        |



2. Feature Construction
Feature construction is the process of creating new features from existing data to help a machine learning model understand the problem better.

| Original Features             | New Constructed Feature            |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `Price` and `Quantity`        | `Total Sales = Price × Quantity`   |
| `Date`                        | `Day`, `Month`, `IsWeekend`        |
| `First Name`, `Last Name`     | `Full Name`                        |
| `Order Date`, `Delivery Date` | `Delivery Time = Delivery - Order` |
| `Height` and `Weight`         | `BMI = Weight / (Height^2)`        |
