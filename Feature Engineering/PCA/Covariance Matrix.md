(::-------------Covariance Matrix-------------::)

The covariance matrix is a square matrix that shows the covariance between every pair of features (variables) in your dataset.

🔢 Example Dataset:

Let’s say you have 3 features:

the formula is

Diagonal: variances of individual features (e.g. Var(X₁), Var(X₂))

Off-diagonal: covariances between pairs (e.g. Cov(X₁, X₂))

📌 Properties:

The matrix is symmetric, i.e. Cov(X₁, X₂) = Cov(X₂, X₁)

Size is n X n where n = number of features

Positive values: variables increase together

Negative values: one increases while the other decreases

Zero: variables are independent


🧠 What is Eigen Decomposition of a Covariance Matrix?

meean when we take Eigen value and Eigen Vector of Covariance Matrix, then what happened.

What is Matrix?

It is Linear Transformation, when we apply matrix to coordinate system, it changes the coordinates

Visualize Here - https://www.geogebra.org/m/YCZa8TAH

we found that applying [[3,0], [1,2]], we get one vector such that its magnitude is 3 times of original but its direction is same.

An eigenvector of a matrix is a vector that doesn't change its direction when a linear transformation is applied to it (only its length may change).

Eigenvectors are the "special directions" that stay pointing the same way even after a transformation.

Eigenvalues tell how much they are stretched or compressed.

📊 Why is this useful in Machine Learning?

In PCA (Principal Component Analysis):

We try to find directions (eigenvectors) where data varies the most.

These are the axes we rotate the data to.

The eigenvalues tell us how much information (variance) is in each direction.

So this entirely depends on what linear transformation we apply.

but where this linear transformation comes from

We calculate the covariance matrix of your dataset.

That covariance matrix is the linear transformation.

Then we find its eigenvectors → directions of maximum variance.

👉 So the transformation comes from data structure itself.

🔢 Example:

![25](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09cf3654-4e0f-4d81-89f3-f59dfe5c5a7b)

A is matrix, v vector is eigen vector , lambda is eigen value, and v vector is sames vector

when we apply A linear transformation on vector v, it it same as we multiply it by one scaler (lambda)

that means uske direction me koi change nahi aa raha, uske scale me change aa raha hai.

and this relationship always True for eigen vector.
