We have x data point on (x, y) axis.

Actually we can say point X is vector which have two component

One is on x direction and other is in y direction

so we have to project this X vector to another vector

(X ko dusare line pe girana hai)

the another vector is also has direction and (x, y) component

we have required direction of this vector

Suppose that another line is u vector
