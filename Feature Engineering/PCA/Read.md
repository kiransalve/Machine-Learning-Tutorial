PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is a dimensionality reduction technique widely used in Machine Learning and Data Science. 

üîç Why Use PCA?

Reduce curse of dimensionality: Useful when you have too many features (columns).

Remove multicollinearity: Highly correlated features are transformed into uncorrelated ones.

Speed up ML algorithms: Less data = faster training.

Improve visualization: Helps visualize data in 2D or 3D.

Noise reduction: Helps reduce overfitting by dropping less informative components.
It transforms high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space while retaining as much variance (information) as possible.


üß† PCA - Working

PCA find the new set of axes by rotating the current axes
