Binning is a technique used to convert continuous numerical variables into categorical bins or intervals

This simplifies the model and sometimes improves performance, especially for algorithms sensitive to non-linear patterns or noise.

1. Equal Width Binning (Uniform)
   
Divides the range of values into equal intervals.

we have to decide no of bins 

Bins = 4

Formula = Max - Min / Bins 
        = 100 - 0 / 4
        = 20

Age: 3,5,7,10,15,18,20,27,30,35,38,42,47,50,55,62,71,90,92

Age:   [0–20], [20–40], [40–60], [60–80]

Bins:     1       2        3        4

then we have to put actual values that fits in bins

and then we count how many items in each bins and plot the histogram

its called equal width i.e. 20

Benifits:

1. Handles Outliers
2. No change in spread of data

2. Equal Frequency/Quantile Binning

you have to give no. of bins

if bins is 10, then each bin contains 10% of total data points



3. K Means Binning

Used when data has clusters (data gathered at one points, and can have as many points)

again we have to give bins (intervals), lets say 5

intervals also called centroid for this 

it takes 5 randomly centroid

1.it calculate distance of each data points with each centroid

2.and then that data points comes under the nearest cluster 

3.then it shift the centroid to the mean of data points of that cluster

4.then again repeat 1,2,3 till previous and current step has no difference

When to Use Binning

To handle outliers or noise in continuous features.

To make models like decision trees or Naive Bayes more effective.

To visualize and interpret data more easily.

To help categorical encoding techniques like one-hot or label encoding.
