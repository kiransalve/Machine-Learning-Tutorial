Normalization is a feature scaling technique that rescales data to a fixed range â€” typically between 0 and 1

We have suppose height and weight columns 

height is in cm and weight is in kgs

height can be in inches, m or feet
weight also can be lbs, pound

so each value have magnitude and unit

we need to eliminate units
and make both columns at common scales

Min Max scaling is most used technique
