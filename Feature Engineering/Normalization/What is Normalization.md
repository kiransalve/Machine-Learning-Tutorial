Normalization is a feature scaling technique that rescales data to a fixed range — typically between 0 and 1

We have suppose height and weight columns 

height is in cm and weight is in kgs

height can be in inches, m or feet
weight also can be lbs, pound

so each value have magnitude and unit

we need to eliminate units
and make both columns at common scales

Min Max scaling is most used technique

Why do we do this?

Because some columns in your data may have:

Small numbers like age (like 11, 20, 35)

Big numbers like salary (like 10,000, 50,000, 1,00,000)

If we use them together in machine learning, the big numbers will dominate the small ones.

Normalization makes them all equally important.


# 🚗 ML Problem: Predicting Car Insurance Risk

## 🧠 Goal:

Predict the **risk level** (High / Medium / Low) for car insurance applicants based on:

| Feature          | Unit  | Range  |
| ---------------- | ----- | ------ |
| Age of Driver    | Years | 18–80  |
| Annual Income    | ₹     | 1L–50L |
| No. of Accidents | Count | 0–10   |

Example dataset:

| Age | Income (₹) | Accidents | Risk   |
| --- | ---------- | --------- | ------ |
| 22  | 3,00,000   | 2         | High   |
| 45  | 12,00,000  | 0         | Low    |
| 30  | 5,00,000   | 1         | Medium |

---

## ⚠️ Problem:

The features have **different scales**:

* Income is in **lakhs**
* Age is in **years**
* Accidents are in **single digits**

ML models like KNN, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, etc., will get biased toward larger numbers (like income), leading to **poor learning**.

## ✅ Solution: Normalize All Features

Using **Min-Max Normalization**:

```
X_normalized = (X - min) / (max - min)
```

Assuming:

* Age: 18–80
* Income: ₹1L–₹50L
* Accidents: 0–10

After normalization:

| Age (norm) | Income (norm) | Accidents (norm) | Risk   |
| ---------- | ------------- | ---------------- | ------ |
| 0.06       | 0.04          | 0.20             | High   |
| 0.43       | 0.22          | 0.00             | Low    |
| 0.19       | 0.08          | 0.10             | Medium |

Now all features are on the **same scale (0–1)**, so ML models can learn fairly.

## 🤖 ML Algorithms that Need Normalization

* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* Logistic Regression
* Neural Networks
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)
* K-Means Clustering

### Algorithms that Don't:

* Decision Trees
* Random Forest
* XGBoost

## 🧠 Analogy:

> Comparing Age (years), Income (₹), and Accidents (count) without normalization is like comparing **apples, oranges, and bananas**.
>
> Normalization turns them into **percentage of their range**, so models compare fairly.
