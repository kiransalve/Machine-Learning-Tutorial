What is Batch Learning?

Batch Learning means training a machine learning model using the entire dataset at once. 
The model sees all the data during training, and once trained, it doesn’t learn anymore unless re-trained with new data.

How it works:

Collect and prepare all the data.
Train the model on this full dataset.
Use the trained model to make predictions.
If new data arrives → retrain the model from scratch (or partially, if supported).

Advantages:

Better performance since it has access to all data at once.
Often more stable and accurate because the model sees the complete picture.
Can leverage optimized matrix operations and hardware like GPUs.


Disadvantages:

Not suitable for very large or continuously updating data (big data).
Retraining from scratch every time new data arrives is computationally expensive.
Not real-time.

Use Cases:

Static datasets (e.g., customer churn prediction, image classification).
Applications where data doesn’t change frequently.
