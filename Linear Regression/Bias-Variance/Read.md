Bias is the error caused by using a simple model that cannot capture the real pattern in the data â€” it leads to underfitting.


### Variance

Variance is the error caused when a model learns even the noise in training data â€” it leads to overfitting.

The bias-variance tradeoff means we have to find the right balance: not too simple (high bias) and not too complex (high variance), 
so our model works well on new, unseen data.

ðŸ“Š Definition:

Bias

Error due to overly simplistic assumptions in the model.

Model underfits the data.

Example: Using a straight line to fit curved data.

Variance

Error due to too much complexity in the model.

Model overfits training data (memorizes it).

Example: A 10-degree polynomial that passes through every point.

Overfitting

Take every data point seriously, and great result on training data

passed through every data point - called overfitting

it is like a student that do ratta 

Underfitting

Take very casually, not try to pass every data point, not good result on training data

it is like student who bunk class and dont study
