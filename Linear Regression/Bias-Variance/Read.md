Bias is the error caused by using a simple model that cannot capture the real pattern in the data â€” it leads to underfitting.

Variance is the error caused when a model learns even the noise in training data â€” it leads to overfitting.

The bias-variance tradeoff means we have to find the right balance: not too simple (high bias) and not too complex (high variance), 
so our model works well on new, unseen data.

ðŸ“Š Definition:

Bias

Error due to overly simplistic assumptions in the model.

Model underfits the data.

Example: Using a straight line to fit curved data.

Variance

Error due to too much complexity in the model.

Model overfits training data (memorizes it).

Example: A 10-degree polynomial that passes through every point.
