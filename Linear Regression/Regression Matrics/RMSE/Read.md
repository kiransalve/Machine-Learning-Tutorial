It is square root of MSE

used in Deep Learning

It has same unit as target column

🧠 Intuition:

RMSE is just the square root of MSE

It gives the average error, like MAE, but penalizes big errors more (due to squaring)

The unit of RMSE is same as the target variable (unlike MSE which is squared)




| Metric | Penalizes Large Errors? | Unit Same as Target? | Easy to Interpret? |
| ------ | ----------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------ |
| MAE    | No                      | ✅ Yes                | ✅ Yes              |
| MSE    | ✅ Yes                   | ❌ No                 | ❌ No               |
| RMSE   | ✅ Yes                   | ✅ Yes                | ✅ Yes              |
