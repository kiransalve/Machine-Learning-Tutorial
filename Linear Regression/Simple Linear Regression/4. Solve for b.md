# ðŸŽ¯ Given Error Function:

![b1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3082be95-8aae-438c-87a0-829a77ada5fd)

Letâ€™s only focus on finding b. 

We'll take the partial derivative with respect to b and set it to 0 to minimize the error.

âœ… Step 1: Take Partial Derivative of Error w.r.t. b

Chain rule

We apply chain rule and get below, 

![b2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e484a87-ed5c-42ef-a3fb-8ca956ed65dc)

after differentiation

yi will be 0,  mxi will be 0 and b will be -1

âœ… Step 2: Set Derivative to 0

Divide both sides by -2:

âœ… Step 3: Expand the Summation

![b5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7293c1d2-5049-4dfe-bbcf-429af18d056e)

Since b is a constant:

![b6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/586e00fd-3969-41b4-a9df-44db8ea21efb)

So the equation becomes:

âœ… Step 4: Solve for b

âœ… Step 5: Rewrite Using Means

This shows that the intercept is what remains of the target value y, after accounting for the influence of x.
