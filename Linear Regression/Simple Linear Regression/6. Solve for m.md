formula for b is 

![m4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df45b7cb-920b-48bb-a175-ad9acde77e38)


we put value of b in above

![m3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eda4f3ef-f427-4cb0-95a4-a8e72c05a17a)

now we have to find out partial derivetive of E with respective to m

we will apply chain rule again
