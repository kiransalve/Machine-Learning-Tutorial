| Symbol | Meaning                            | Example             |
| ------ | ---------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `y`    | Output / Dependent variable        | Package ðŸ’°          |
| `x`    | Input / Independent variable       | CGPA ðŸŽ“             |
| `m`    | Slope of the line                  | 1.5 (growth factor) |
| `b`    | Intercept (where line cuts y-axis) | 2.0 (base salary)   |


we can solve above equetion by two method

1. Closed form solution

direct formula

also called Ordinary least square

2. Non - closed form solution

approximation based technique

where we use differentiation

called Gradient Descent


Why there is Gradient Descent if we have direct formula?

because in higher dimmension, (more feature or columns) to perform calculation become complex and takes more energy


but in scikit class there are OLS is implemented

we have SGDRegressor() that uses GD


# Invent the formula from Scratch
