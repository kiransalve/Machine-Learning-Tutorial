# 🏔️ Finding the Minimum of a Function with Partial Derivatives

## 🧠 Big-Picture Intuition  

> **Goal**: Locate the *lowest* point (the **minimum**) of a multivariable function.  
> **Tool**: Calculus — **partial derivatives** — they measure how steep the surface is along each axis.

## 🏞️ Imagine the Landscape  

- You’re on a **hilly 3-D terrain** (think of a giant rubber sheet).  
- You’re **blindfolded** and want to find the *deepest valley*.  
- At every step you can test the **slope** in only **one direction at a time**:
  - East ↔ West → *x-direction*  
  - North ↔ South → *y-direction*

## 📐 What Are Partial Derivatives?  

| Direction | What you do | Math twin | Meaning |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|---------|
| East-West | Take a tiny step \( \Delta x \) | \( \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x} \) | How fast “height” changes left–right |
| North-South | Take a tiny step \( \Delta y \) | \( \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial y} \) | How fast “height” changes forward–back |

A **partial derivative** is simply the *slope* if you freeze all other directions except one.

## ⛳ How Do You Know You’re at the Bottom?

1. **Feel the slope** in every direction (compute each partial derivative).  
2. If **all** those slopes are **zero**:  
   - The ground isn’t tilting up or down **anywhere you probe**.  
   - You’re at a **critical point** — potentially the valley.  
3. Use second-derivative tests (or just picture the terrain) to confirm it’s a *minimum* rather than a saddle or peak.

Mathematically, solve  
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 0 \quad\text{and}\quad \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 0
\]  
(and for more variables, add one equation per variable).

# Finding a minimum is like standing on a hill and feeling the ground in every direction.
# Partial derivatives are your senses; when they all say “flat,” you’ve reached the valley.


## 🔍 Step-by-Step Cheat-Sheet  

```text
1. Write down your multivariable function f(x, y, ...)
2. Compute each partial derivative: ∂f/∂x, ∂f/∂y, ...
3. Set them all equal to zero ➜ solve the system ➜ get candidate points.
4. (Optional) Check the Hessian / use intuition to confirm a true minimum.
