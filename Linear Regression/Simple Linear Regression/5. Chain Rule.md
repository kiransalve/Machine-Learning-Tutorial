# 🔗 Chain Rule in Partial Derivatives (Human Intuition)

## 🎯 Real-Life Analogy: Climbing a Mountain

Imagine you're hiking up a mountain 🏔️ and your **altitude** depends on your position on the map:

- Your altitude is `z = f(x, y)`
- But your position `(x, y)` depends on **time `t`** because you're walking.

So:  

apply chain rule z = f(x(t), y(t))

## ❓ What are we trying to find?

> "As time passes, how fast is my height (z) changing?"

This is `dz/dt`, and it depends on:

- How fast you're moving in the x-direction → `dx/dt`
- How fast you're moving in the y-direction → `dy/dt`
- How altitude changes with x and y → `∂z/∂x` and `∂z/∂y`

---

## 📐 Chain Rule Formula

The **total rate of change** in altitude is:

dz/dt = ∂z/∂x * dx/dt + ∂z/∂y * dy/dt


Each term means:
- `∂z/∂x`: how steep the slope is in the x-direction  
- `dx/dt`: how fast you're walking in the x-direction  
- Same for y-direction.

## 🧠 Intuition Summary

- You are not changing `z` directly.
- You're changing `x` and `y` over time.
- These changes **indirectly** change `z`.
- Chain Rule **combines** all these small effects into total change.

## 💡 Think Like This:
> “If something depends on many things, and those things change,  
> total change is the sum of each part’s effect.”

## ✨ Bonus: General Form

If `z = f(x, y)` and `x = g(u, v)`, `y = h(u, v)`, then:


∂z/∂u = ∂f/∂x * ∂x/∂u + ∂f/∂y * ∂y/∂u
