Polynomial Regression is a type of linear regression where the relationship between the independent variable x and 
the dependent variable y is modeled as an nth-degree polynomial. 

It is useful when your data shows non-linear patterns but you still want to use linear regression techniques.

ðŸ’¡ Human Intuition:

Imagine you're drawing a curve that fits your data points. A straight line may not capture the bends or curves. 

Polynomial regression allows the model to bend to better fit the data by adding powers of x.

ðŸ“Œ When to Use:

Data shows a curved trend (U-shape or inverse U-shape).

Linearity assumption of simple linear regression fails.

Youâ€™ve plotted your residuals and see a pattern (non-random).

ðŸ“ˆ Visualization Tip:

Always plot your predictions vs actual data. Polynomial regression can easily overfit if the degree is too high.

ðŸš¨ Important Interview Tips:

Itâ€™s still considered linear regression because coefficients are linear.

Polynomial regression increases the model complexity.

Always scale your data before polynomial transformation if you're using regularization (e.g., Ridge, Lasso).
