Elastic Net Regression is a type of linear regression that combines Ridge Regression (L2 regularization) 
and Lasso Regression (L1 regularization). 

Itâ€™s useful when you have many features and some of them are correlated or irrelevant.

Elastic Net Regression is a mix of Ridge and Lasso Regression that combines their penalty terms. 

The name "Elastic Net" comes from physics: just like an elastic net can stretch and still keep its shape, 
this method adapts to data while maintaining structure.

The model balances three goals: minimizing prediction errors, keeping the size of coefficients small (like Lasso), 
and preventing any coefficient from becoming too large (like Ridge).
