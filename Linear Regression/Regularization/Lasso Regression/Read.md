LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator)

Lasso also has a way to reduce the importance of certain factors to zero, 
which makes it useful for two main tasks: making predictions and identifying the most important features.
 
Lasso Regression is a type of linear regression that uses L1 regularization.

It adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the coefficients, which helps the model reduce some coefficients to zero.

This way, it performs feature selection automatically — keeping only the most important features.

Our coefficient can be zero

Higher value impacted more

for  (λ)lambda value -

For less value Bias is small and variance is more

For higher value Bias is more and variance is small

This tries to minimize prediction error only — the model can make coefficients as big as it wants to fit the data.
