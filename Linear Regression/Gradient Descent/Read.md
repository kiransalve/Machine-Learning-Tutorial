Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize a cost or loss function in machine learning models.

It works by:

Calculating the gradient (slope) of the loss function with respect to the modelâ€™s parameters.

Updating the parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient to reduce the error.

Repeating this step iteratively until the algorithm converges to a minimum (ideally the global minimum).

Add Practical Relevance
 
For example, in linear regression, gradient descent helps find the best-fit line by minimizing the difference between predicted and actual values
