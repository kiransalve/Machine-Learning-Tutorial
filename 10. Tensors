Tensors is basic data structure

It is so important that googles library Tensorflow named from Tensor

It is container, where we store numbers (for 99.99%)

0 dimension - Scalars (2), (3)
1 dimension - Vectors, 
2D Matrics are all tensors as general term 

tensors and n-dimensional array are same thing

1d array
2d array ke andar array
3d array ke andar array uske andar array

axis means how many dimension you have

suppose 
a = [1,2,3,4]
It is one dimension vector 
it is 1d array
it is 1d tensor

but how many dimensions it have - 4d
becasue it has 4 numbers

same 
b = [3,5,6]
It is one dimension vector 
it is 1d array
it is 1d tensor

but it have 3d dimensions
