Tensors is basic data structure

It is so important that googles library Tensorflow named from Tensor

It is container, where we store numbers (for 99.99%)

0 dimension - Scalars (2), (3)
1 dimension - Vectors, 
2D Matrics are all tensors as general term 

tensors and n-dimensional array are same thing

1d array
2d array ke andar array
3d array ke andar array uske andar array

axis means how many dimension you have

suppose 
a = [1,2,3,4]
It is one dimension vector 
it is 1d array
it is 1d tensor

but how many dimensions it have - 4d
becasue it has 4 numbers

same 
b = [3,5,6]
It is one dimension vector 
it is 1d array
it is 1d tensor

but it have 3d dimensions

another imporatant thing 
if we add multiple scalars then we get vectors

if we add "pichhala" dimension then we get next dimension

No. of Rank = No. of Axes = No. of Dimension

Shape means "row me aap maximum kitane item store kar sakte ho aur column me aap maximum kitane item store kar sakte ho"

shape (2,3)

Size is row X cols
it is total item in tensor
