1. Business Problem to ML Problem

Netfilx 

We are lead Data scientist
there are meeting how to increase revenue 
all the CEO, CFO are present
I am seating meeting, and they ask you to how to boost revenue

1. New Customer by marketing
2. More charge on existing customer
3. retain customer who left (reduce churn rate)

churn rate means in given time frame how many customers are left the platform
suppose 100 customer are there and churn rate is 2% monthly,
means 2 customer monthly leave the platform so it becomes 98

to eise to monthly 2% kam hoke pure customer left ho jayenge
to eisa nahi hai, new customer bhi judte hai
aur new customer rate is always greater than chaurn rate

it is like birth rate and death rate
if death rate is more then population is less
if birth rate is more then population is also more


so my task is to reduce churn rate
if i successfully stop them to left, i get revenue from them

so Business Problem is Increase Revenue
and we converted it to ML problem to - Reduce Churn Rate (like 2% to 1.75%)

your first instict should be how to convert it to mathamatical problem
If we reduce monthly churn from 2% → 1.75%, it significantly boosts revenue without extra customer acquisition cost.

2.Type of Problem

see big picture
what will be the end product
what type of problem we are solving 

what we can do, is we give discount who are leaving the platform for next month
their is probability if we give discount then customer not leave 
so here we have find out the problem that who are leaving and who are not 
so it is classification problem where output is yes or no

but then we can think that all are not same

some customer are more eager to leave the platform, some are not
so we need score from 0 to 100 that gives us sentiment 
that how much customer eager to leave

so now it is regression problem where our output is no.

3.Current Solution
if in past someone done this type of work 
you can take that and refine instead start from scratch

4.Getting data

Watch time - how much time he is browsing and how much time on actually watching video
if he spent much time on browsing it means he not found what he is looking for
if he spent time on streaming that is fine, it is good 

search but not found
how much he search and he not found

how many time left content in middle
it means your content is not that quality to attach customer for long time

5.Matrics to measure
it is north star so it will guide you that you are going on right direction or not

Reduce Churn	- Monthly churn rate (e.g., from 2% to 1.75%)
Model Performance	- AUC-ROC, Precision/Recall, F1 Score
Business Impact -	Revenue gained from saved customers

6. Online and Batch learning

Batch Learning - Train on past 6 months’ data, update weekly/monthly

Online Learning -	Continuously update model as new data arrives (ideal for real-time personalization)

7.Check assumption

Do customer behaviors differ by geography?
Yes. Viewing habits in India vs USA are very different.
Solution: Train separate models or include region/country as a feature.
