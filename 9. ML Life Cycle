Set of guideline you have to follow when developing ML model, from idea to products

End to End product requirement in industry

1. Framing the Problem
Decide 
what is exactly problem, 
what we have to solve, 
What is cost, 
Who is customer, 
How much team members required,
How end product looks like, 
ML model is supervised or unsupervised, 
It is on batch mode or offline mode, 
Which types of algorithm to be used what is data sources

2. Gathering the data
Data could be multiple sources
CSV
API
Web Scraping
Database -> we cant use directly, we make Data Werehouse and ETL process
Spark - Big cluster

IMP is collecting data and store in correct format

3. Data Preprocessing
preprocessing means changes before processing data

data may be unstructured, dirty
we cant pass on this data to ML models, because result not correct

structure issues, missing values, outliers, noisy, 
can be uncompatible if data is coming from multiple sources, number of columns is different
remove duplicates,
scale the values (like one column in thousand and another in crores called standerdization),

4. EDA (Exploratory data analysis)
experiment with data
relationship between columns
visualization
Univariate analysis (mean, std, curve, avg, max, min)
Bivariate analysis
Outlier detection
imbalance - like if you have image classification problem and you have large cats image but less dog images)
What is data all about
spent more time on this

5.Feature Engineering and Selection
Feature - input columns
adding columns
like bedroom, washroom -> area
remove column that does not impact on output

6. Model Training, Evalution and Selection
find algorithm that best results
based on matrics
we tune the model for better results
we can mix model for optimized output

7. Model Deployment
convert model to software so user can use it
it can be app, website or web app

we make binary file (pickle), and convert API (API - Application Programing Interface - if we give correct input it 
gives us json)
user give input by form, this input gets the python app, this app send this input to API, then binary file make 
prediction based on input and give back json to user UI

8. Testing
we give app or features to trusted customer

9. Optimize
- mdel Backup
- Data backup
- automation if model break
- load balancing
- retrain model
- frequency of training and automating
- cost optimization
