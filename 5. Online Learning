What is Online Learning?

Online Learning is a machine learning approach where the model learns incrementally, 
by processing one data point or mini-batch at a time, instead of the whole dataset at once.

It's perfect for situations where:

Data comes in streams (e.g., stock prices, user behavior).
The dataset is too large to fit into memory.
You want the model to adapt in real-time.

How it works:

The model starts with initial parameters.
For each new data point (or small batch), it updates its parameters.
It learns continuously and can adapt to new patterns.

Advantages:

Real-time learning – ideal for changing environments.
Works well with large-scale or streaming data.
Doesn’t require storing all past data (memory efficient).

Disadvantages:

More prone to noise and outliers, especially if the learning rate isn't well tuned.
Might forget past patterns (called catastrophic forgetting).
Harder to tune than batch models.

Use Cases:

Fraud detection systems (learning from new frauds as they occur).
Real-time recommendation engines (Netflix, Amazon etc)
Clickstream data analysis.
Self-driving car models.

Comparison: Online Learning vs Batch Learning

| **Feature**         | **Online Learning**               | **Batch Learning**            |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Data Handling**   | One-by-one / mini-batch           | Whole dataset                 |
| **Real-time updates** | Yes                             | No                            |
| **Adaptability**    | High (learns new trends)          | Low (retrain needed)          |
| **Memory usage**    | Low                               | High                          |
