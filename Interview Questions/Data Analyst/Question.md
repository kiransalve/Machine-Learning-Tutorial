Question 1

Can you please introduce yourself and tell me why you’re applying for this Data Analyst role at Capgemini?

Answer 1

"Hi, I’m Kiran. I’ve been working for the past 7 years in the Sales and Marketing department of a manufacturing company,
mainly as an MIS Analyst with a strong focus on data analysis. 

Over time, I’ve naturally grown into a data analyst role by handling responsibilities like daily sales tracking, 
forecast vs actual analysis, marketing scheme achievement reporting, incentive calculation 
and even financial tasks like outstanding reports, DSO reports, freight analysis and Product cost analysis

I work daily with tools like pivot tables, Power BI, and MySQL to prepare dashboards and reports that support both sales and finance teams. 

One of the best things I have done is automating our weekly zonal sales performance dashboard using Power BI, 
which gave our Zonal Heads real-time visibility into sales performance and helped them take quicker decisions.
It have HQ wise data like budget vs actual sales, pending and finance hold orders, current month dificit, ytd dificit, collection vs outstanding 
and inventory lying with distributor end.

I’m now have experince to work with cross functional teams like purchase, dispatch, finance, accounts teams and also work 
independantly on any given project, currently I am trying to connect our dashboard to directly to SAP Hana instead of MySQL.

I’m applying for this Data Analyst role at Capgemini because I want to take the next step in 
my career — work on more advanced data projects, collaborate with diverse teams, and learn from experienced professionals in a structured, 
fast-paced environment of Capgemini.
I know Capgemini is a leader in digital transformation and analytics, and I’m excited to contribute my domain experience, 
strong reporting skills, and eagerness to grow into more advanced analytics and AI-driven roles over time
